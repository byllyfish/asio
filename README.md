# asio

Fork of [ASIO C++ library](https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio) that tracks chriskohlhoff's master branch, but is compatible with [BoringSSL](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/).

ASIO is already BoringSSL "compatible". However, BoringSSL is a moving target. This fork can be used when the ASIO master has not caught up with the latest BoringSSL source changes.
